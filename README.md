2. Display a list of all vehicles currently in the parking lot.
3. Update the vehicle's exit time.
4. Delete the record of a vehicle when it leaves the parking lot.
5. A small login system will be created to grant user access to the system.
6. A system for monthly and annual memberships will be implemented, with different prices depending on the type of vehicle.
7. Vehicles with these memberships will not be charged for entry or exit, and will have a special attribute for identification.

## Cost Calculation üí≤

The cost will be calculated based on the vehicle's duration of stay and its type (motorcycles, cars, and trucks will have different rates).

## Data Validation üëÅ

1. Validate the license plate format as ABC-123 and ABC-12D.
2. Validate that the assigned space is available.
